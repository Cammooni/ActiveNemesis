## What is Post-Compromise Enumeration and when?
==After taking over a user in the domain==, we can utilize different useful tools that can help us in enumeration.
## What do I look for?
- Targets of high value
	- Domain admins
	- Enterprise admins
	- Other accounts (other than the one that we're enumerating from)
	- Architecture of devices
- ANY INFORMATION THAT CAN BE USEFUL (THINK OUTSIDE OF THE BOX)
