## Pivoting
### Through SSH
1. Establish the proxy through an SSH connection
```bash
ssh -f -N -D <proxy-chains-config-port> -i pivot <user>@<user-ip>
# -f Runs the ssh session the background
# -N Perfect for port forwarding
# -D Binds the port specified
# -i Identity file 
```
2. Run you commands through the proxy!
```bash
proxychains <command>
```
